# 🛡️ Defense in Depth/Interal Network Lab Progress

## 📌 Overview  
This repository documents my progress in building a **Defense in Depth** cybersecurity lab. It includes **network segmentation, attack simulations, monitoring, and response mechanisms** to enhance security posture.

---

## 📂 Lab Architecture  
- **pfSense (Firewall)** - Handles network security, traffic filtering, and segmentation.  
- **Kali Linux (Red & Blue Team)** - Offensive security testing and network monitoring.  
- **Metasploitable (Target System)** - Vulnerable machine for exploitation practice.  
- **Ubuntu (Monitoring & Analysis)** - Used for observation and further analysis.  
- **RHEL (Server Management)** - Reserved for Red Hat Linux study and system hardening.

---

## 🔴 Red Team Tools (Offensive Security)  
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `arpspoof` | Simulates man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks |
| `urlsnarf` | Captures and analyzes HTTP traffic |
| `Metasploit` | Exploitation framework for testing vulnerabilities |
| `Nmap` | Network scanning for open ports and services |
| `sysctl` | Enables port forwarding for traffic interception |

---

## 🔵 Blue Team Tools (Defensive Security)  
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `arpDetector.py` | Detects ARP spoofing attacks (Implemented) |
| `netdiscover` | Tracks IPs, MACs, and device activity |
| `Wireshark` | Packet capture and deep traffic analysis |
| `sysctl` | IP forwarding management for traffic monitoring |
| Custom Python Scripts | Automates detection for ARP spoofing and attack simulations |

## 📈 Findings & Improvements  
### ✅ **Successes**  
- Successfully detected ARP spoofing attacks using **`arpDetector.py`**.  
- Verified firewall rules in **pfSense** to block unauthorized traffic.  

### ⚠️ **Challenges & Next Steps**  
- Need to fine-tune **monitoring alerts** for better log correlation.  
- Implement **host-based security** (endpoint protection and logging).
